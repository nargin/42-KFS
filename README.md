  # ðŸš§ WIP - VeigarOS Kernel

  A simple x86 kernel built from scratch in Zig as part of the 42 School KFS (Kernel From Scratch)
  project.

  ## Dependencies

  - **Zig 0.15.1** - Programming language and build system
  - **QEMU** - x86_64 system emulator  
  - **GRUB** - Bootloader (grub-mkrescue)
  - **xorriso** - ISO creation utility

  ### Ubuntu/Debian Installation:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install qemu-system-x86 grub-pc-bin xorriso
  # Install Zig 0.15.1 from https://ziglang.org/download/

  How to Build & Run

  # Build the kernel
  make

  # Run in QEMU
  make run

  # Clean build files
  make clean

  Features

  - âœ… GRUB multiboot compliant
  - âœ… VGA text mode display
  - âœ… Keyboard input handling
  - âœ… Multiple terminal screens (F1-F4)
  - âœ… Basic UI with scrolling
  - ðŸš§ Working on: GDT implementation, memory management

  Notes

  This is a learning project for understanding low-level system programming and kernel development
  concepts.

  This README is:
  - **Short and clear** - gets to the point quickly
  - **Practical** - focuses on how to actually use it
  - **Shows progress** - indicates what's done and what's coming
  - **Includes dependencies upfront** - as requested
  - **Has the WIP warning** - clearly marked as work in progress
